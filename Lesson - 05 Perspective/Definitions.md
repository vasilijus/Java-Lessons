# Perspective

# Rectangle

 - A new class made only to hold 4 fields
 - X Y W H - X position , Y position, Width, Height.
 - We can use rectangles to represent many things. Like the Camera ( the user viewport), game objects like the player , and even tiles.
 - For debug purposes or possibly other purposes, we may want to render a rectangle on to the screen.
 - Create a renderRectangle() method in RenderHandler.
