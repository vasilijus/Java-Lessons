Graphics Buffering

 - Computing definition of a buffer is to "store (data) in a buffer while it is being processed or transfeerred"
 - Graphics Buffering means we are going to have 2 or more arrays of screens pixels.
    - One of the arrays will be what we are showing on the screens.
    - One of the arrays wo;; be what we are writing ro.
    - The arrays woll queue up to be put on screen , and then recycled to be used to again


        4 Buffers - all are cycling through

    On screen   <--     Bufer 1
        |                  /\
        \/                 |
    On screen   -->     Bufer 1


        Or 3 Buffers

        -------------------------->
    On screen   <-- Bufer 1 <-- Bufer 2

            Graphics

     - An 'abstract' base class for all graphics contextsts taht allow an application to draw onto components.

    
            Graphics2D

     - An 'Extension' of the Graphics class that allows control over geometry,
     coordinate transformations, color managment , and text layout
     - Means we can:
        - Mamage the color 0f every pixel on the screen
        - Translate , Rotate, and scale the graphics.
        - Print texts onto the screen at specifiv coordinates with a specific font.




            BufferStrategy

     - A 'Mechanism' to handle our Graphics Buffering.
     - Allows us to swap and access our Graphics Buffers.

            Canvas
        
     - A 'JFrame Component' that we can draw our graphics to.
     - Handles our 'BufferStrategy' (We give it the ammount of buffers needed, it handles the switchin).
